* ⚠ Currently, portion of `Descriptions` are Japanese only.
* This was started to research what we can do now in XISMO2 beta0 scripting APIs.

## Notes

* [`XISMO2`](http://mqdl.jpn.org/) is a 3D modelling software for Windows.
*  Pronunciation of `XISMO` for this software is written `キスモ` (/kisumo/) for Japanese in the official site. So, I think a better pronunciation for English is /kismo/.
* XISMO2 beta0 scripting language: `JavaScript`
* ⚠ We should aware of beta releases are intended for our cooperation to debug, and are announced expiration dates.
