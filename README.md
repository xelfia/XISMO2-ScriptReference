* This has started to research what we can do now in XISMO2 (200 beta0...final) scripting APIs.

## Notes

* [`XISMO2`](http://mqdl.jpn.org/) is a 3D modelling software for Windows.
* On the official site, pronunciation of `XISMO` is written as `キスモ` (🔈/kisumo/) for `Japanese`. So, I think a better pronunciation for `English` is 🔈/kismo/.
* XISMO2 beta0…final scripting language: `JavaScript`
* ⚠ When beta versions provided: We should aware of beta releases are intended for our cooperation to debug, and are announced expiration dates.
