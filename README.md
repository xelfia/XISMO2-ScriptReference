## Notes

* [`XISMO2`](http://mqdl.jpn.org/) is a 3D modelling software for Windows.
* On the official site, pronunciation of `XISMO` is written as `„Ç≠„Çπ„É¢` (üîà/kisumo/) for `Japanese`. So, I think a better pronunciation for `English` is üîà/kismo/.
* XISMO2 beta0‚Ä¶1 scripting language: `JavaScript`
* ‚ö† We should aware of beta releases are intended for our cooperation to debug, and are announced expiration dates.
